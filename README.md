# Code Generator using WorqHat AI

So what are we building today? Today we're going to build our very own AI bot using the latest
and greatest technology - the AiConV2 Text Generation model by WorqHat AI. And not just any bot,
we're talking about a bot thatâ€™s going to generate code from commands to any programming language of
your choice!

This project is important, because it will give you basic understanding of how to build AI based
project using the latest Text Generation APIs. Cool, right?!Let's start with the one
and only Code Translator that you're ever going to want to build!

But don't take my word for it, you gotta try it out for yourself. We've got a live code
translator on this [page](https://text-to-code-with-worqhat-ai.vercel.app/), that's already
causing a stir. People can't get enough of it! So, before you even start this course, go check it
out and see what all the fuss is about.So, are you ready to step up and take on the challenge? Let's
do this!
